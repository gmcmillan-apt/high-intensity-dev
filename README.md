# high-intensity-dev

**A sustainability framework for developers working at high intensity with AI agents.**

---

AI-assisted development has specific burnout vectors that traditional software engineering does not. The feedback loop is instant. Results feel cheap. Your backlog feels infinite because your capability feels infinite. You look up and 6 hours have passed and you never decided to work that long.

This framework is a collection of principles and practical patterns for sustaining high-intensity AI-paired development over months and years — without breaking yourself.

## Who This Is For

Anyone using AI coding assistants at high intensity:

- **Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot / Codex** — if you're pairing with AI for hours a day
- **Team leads** managing developers who work with AI agents
- **Solo developers** shipping fast and feeling the burn

## The Five Rules

1. **Define "done for today" before you start.** When the condition is met, stop. No extensions.
2. **Cap deep work at 4-5 hours.** Take 15 minutes off every 90 minutes. No exceptions during crunch.
3. **Shut down visibly.** Write tomorrow's first task, close everything, leave the workspace.
4. **Sleep is non-negotiable.** Two nights under 6.5 hours = mandatory reduced workload the next day.
5. **You are not the project.** If pausing for 3 months would destabilize your identity, recalibrate.

## Contents

### [The Guide](guide.md)

The full sustainability guide — covers the AI development trap, neurochemistry of flow vs. burnout, daily work structure, sleep protection, recovery protocols, and the infinite backlog problem.

### [Patterns](patterns/)

Practical, implementable patterns for specific failure modes:

- **[Workstate Tracking](patterns/workstate-tracking.md)** — Externalize parallel thread state to prevent invisible cognitive overload. Includes a Claude Code integration that auto-tracks your active workstreams.

### [Claude Code Integration](claude-code/)

Ready-to-use snippets for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) users:

- **[CLAUDE.md Snippet](claude-code/CLAUDE-snippet.md)** — Copy-paste into your project for automatic workstate tracking
- **[Workstate Template](claude-code/workstate-template.md)** — Empty state table template

## Philosophy

Sustained performance requires oscillation.

> High intensity -> Shutdown -> Recovery -> Return sharp

Continuous redline destroys clarity, judgment, and creativity. The goal is not maximum hours. The goal is maximum useful output per unit of cognitive investment, sustained over months and years.
